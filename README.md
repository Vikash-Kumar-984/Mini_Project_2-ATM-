# Mini_Project_2-ATM-

Woooo...  Hoooo !!!

This is my second project in JAVA language.

Let's start with the description about the project.

The project is 100% Java Language and main idea is to explore the working of the ATM machine in our locality.

As there is no account at the entry point so, at the starting there is the creation of the dummy database so that we can use that data at the running of our program.

User Interface :)

Select 1: Default ( Already computer will create the default account  )

Select 2: Manual ( Create your own account )

After entering the details ,the account will be created and according to that the whole function will run.

ATM functions *

~ Balance Check

~ Change your pin

~ Withdrawal ( should not exceed the deposited amount )

~ After withdrawing the updated amount will display.


Thank you :) 

Hope u enjoy the code !!!
